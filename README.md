WINNING PERCENTAGE:
To calculate a team's winning percentage, input the amount of wins, losses, and ties they have/could have into the parentheses of their corresponding variables at the top of the program.

Once you have done that, run the program. It will display the team's record and calculated winning percentage (which will be rounded) in the console log.

TOTAL POINTS (NHL):

Once you have done that, run the program. It will display the team's record and calculated amount of points based on the record in the console log.

PITCHING CALCULATOR:
